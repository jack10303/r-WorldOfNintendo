This repo uses [CodeKit](https://incident57.com/codekit/) to manage some SASS things for me (mostly Autoprefixer), but you can use whatever you like!

##To Do
* stylize headings and content
* stylize the prev/next buttons
* stylize the user flair selection element(s)
* create some `@extends` and `$vars` for stuff
* add some more minor fancy animations on random things (search, voting buttons, default thumbnails, etc)
* replace the "WORLD OF" typeface with the correct typeface (gotta find out what it is) or scan the actual cardboard
